<h3> As Hubert Davis loves to say, the Tar Heels got invited to the Los Angeles Tournament, as they'll square off against the Alabama Crimson Tide on Thursday night. This will be another tough task for the Tar Heels, the No. 1 seed in the West Region, as they'll compete against a team that, like them, likes to push the pace.  </h3>
